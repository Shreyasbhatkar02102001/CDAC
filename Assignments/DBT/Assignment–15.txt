			Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions 
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one 
customer into this table.

insert into multicast (Snum, Sname, City, Commm)
select s.snum, s.sname, s.city, s.comm
from salespeople s
JOIN customers c ON s.snum = c.snum
group by s.snum, s.sname, s.city, s.comm
having count(c.cnum) > 1;

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

delete c.* 
from customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.cnum = o.cnum
where o.cnum is NULL;


3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all 
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000

update salespeople 
set comm = comm + 0.20
where  snum in (
	select o.snum
	from orders o
	group by o.snum
	having sum(o.amt) > 3000
);

1) Write two different queries that would produce all orders taken on October 3rd or 
4th, 1990.

select * from orders where Odate = '1990-10-03' or Odate = '1990-10-04';

select * from orders where Odate > '1990-10-02' and Odate < '1990-10-05';


2) Write a query that selects all of the customers serviced by Peel or Motika.
(Hint: the snum field relates the two tables to one another).

select c.*  from customers c JOIN salespeople s ON c.snum = s.snum where sname = "Pearl" or sname = "Motika";


3) Write a query that will produce all the customers whose names begin with a letter 
from ‘A’ to ‘G’.

select * from customers where cname between 'a' and 'h%';


4) Write a query that selects all customers whose names begin with the letter ‘C’

select * from customers where cname like 'c%';


5) Write a query that selects all orders except those with zeroes or NULLs in the amt 
field

select * from orders where amt is not null or amt = 0;

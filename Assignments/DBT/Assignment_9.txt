				Querying Multiple Tables at Once.

1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer 
who made the order.

select o.onum, c.cname from customers c JOIN orders o ON c.cnum = o.cnum; 


2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for 
each order along with the order number


select s.sname, c.cname, o.onum 
from orders o 
JOIN salespeople s ON o.snum = s.snum
JOIN customers c ON o.cnum = c.cnum;


3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a 
commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name, 
and the salesperson’s rate of commission.


select c.cname, s.sname, s.comm 
FROM salespeople s 
JOIN customers c ON s.snum = c.snum
where s.comm > 0.12;

4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each 
order by a customer with a rating above 100

select o.onum, o.amt*s.comm as Commission_Amt 
from salespeople s 
JOIN orders o ON s.snum = o.snum
JOIN customers c ON s.snum = c.snum 
where rating > 100;

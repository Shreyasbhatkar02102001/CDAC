#### select * from emp 

-  ; is known as delimiter
-  it indicates end if command

-  changing the delimiter is known as Personalisation

#### PL ( Programming Language ) 

-   MySQL Programming Language
-   programming language from MySQL
-   product of MySQL
-   used for database programming
-   e.g. HRA_CALC , TAX_CALC, ATTENDANCE_CALC, etc.


- Every RDMS has its own native programming language :-

![[Pasted image 20241018144252.png]]

MySQL - PL  :   most popular language for open-source RDMS about 42%
Oracle ( PL /SQL )  :  most popular language for commerical RDMS about 63%

- used for server-side data processing 

![[Pasted image 20241018145037.png]]

-   MySQL - PL program can be called in MySQL command line client, MySQL Workbench, Java ,     MS .Ney, C++, etc.; can  be called through any front-end s/w
-   

Oracle port no :  1521;

![[Pasted image 20241018151129.png]]
-   execution is top to bottom

![[Pasted image 20241018151434.png]]

-   MySQL - PL program is commonly referred to as a MySQL - PL block
-   Block level language ( feature of OOPS )

![[Pasted image 20241018152013.png]]

-  Benefits of Block level language :-
	-  a. Modularity 
	-  b. Control scope of variables (form of data hiding)  ( Encapsulation )
	-  c.  Efficient error management with the help of exceptions

-   Screen input and screen output is not allowed ( scanf , printf, etc.  not available )
-   used only for processing
-   can use SELECT statement inside the block but it's not recommended
-   SQL commands that are allowed inside MySQL-PL block: -  DDL, DML,  DQL,  DTL/TCL
-   DCL commands are not allowed inside MySQL-PL program

STORED PROCEDURES 

![[Pasted image 20241018160913.png]]
-   Routine (set of commands) that  has to be called explicity
-   global procedures
-   stored in the database
-   can be called through MySQL command line client, MySQL workbench, java, MS .Net, etc.; can    be called through any front-end s/w
-   Stored in the database in the COMPILED FORMAT
-   hence the exection is very fast
-   hiding the source code from end user
-   execution takes place in server RAM
-   therefore ideally suited for Server-side data processing
-   Procedure can have LOCAL variables
-   within the procedure you can have any processing, all MySQL-PL statements allowed, e.g. IF s    statement, loops, cursors, etc.
-   one procedure can call another procedure
-   procedure can call itself ( known as Recursion )
-   to make it flexible, you can pass parameters to a procedure
-   OVERLOADING OF STORED PROCEDURES IS NOT SUPPORTED; you cannot
	create 2 or more procedures with the same name even if the NUMBER
	of parameters passed is different or the DATATYPE of parameters
	passed is different; because its a stored object

after executing and procedure created messaged will be displayed :

-  if boolean is FALSE then if statement would not work is NOT not mentioned
-  if NOT is mention  then it will work
-  another method is using ELSE statement

table : 
![[Pasted image 20241014143554.png]]


![[Pasted image 20241014142757.png]]

- join based on equality condition
- Shows matching rows of the both the tables
- uses : - 
	- a. DNAME, ENAME
	- B. CNAME, SNAME
-  Most frequently used join  ( >  90 %  )
-  it is also known as Natural join

2.  **==Inequi join ( Non - Equi Join )==**

	-  join based on inquality condition
	- Shows non - matching rows of both the table
	- Uses : -
		- a. Exception Reports
			- i. Who are employees who don't belong to TRN
			- ii. Who are the customers who haven't made the payment

3.  Outer Join

-  join with ( + ) sign or if you use the keyword "Outer"
-  shows  matching rows of  both the tables 
- plus
- non matching rows of "Outer" table
- Outer table ->  table  which is on Outer side of ( + ) sign
- Outer table -> table which is on Opposite side of ( + ) sign


`select dname, ename from emp, dept`
`where dept.deptno = emp.deptno (+);`

a.  Half Outerjoin ( 1 Do-While loop, 1 For loop )
		i.  right Outerjoin  
		ii. Left Outerjoin

b.  Full Outerjoin ( Nested Do-While loop )

![[Pasted image 20241014151918.png]]

-  Shows matching rows of both the tables
-  plus
-  non matching rows of the both  the tables

- UNION of the Right .....

INNER JOIN 
- by default every join is Inner jin; putting a ( + )sign or using the keyword "Outer" is what makes it an Outerjoin.

![[Pasted image 20241014153240.png]]

4.  Cartesian Join ( Cross Join ) 

- Join without a WHERE clause
- every row of driving table is combined  with each and every row of driven table
- it tables the cross product of 2 tables and therefore it's also known as Cross join

select dname, ename from emp, dept;

![[Pasted image 20241014154211.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241014154853.png]]

Uses : 
-  For printing purposes
	- e.g  :  in STUDENTS table you have all the students names, in SUBJECTS tables you have all the subjects names; when you are printing the mark-sheets for the students, every student name is combined with each and every  ....................

5.  Self join 

-  joining  atable to itself
-  used when parent column and column, both are present in the same table
-  Slowest join ( based on Recursion )

`select a.ename, b.ename from emp b, emp a`
`where a.mgr = b.empno;`

Uses:
	a. ENAME,  MGRNAME

![[Pasted image 20241014162036.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241014162100.png]]

==*Cartesian join is the Fastest join Fastest join , because there is no WHERE clause, and therefore there is no searching involved*==

## Types of Relationship

![[Pasted image 20241014165909.png]]


![[Pasted image 20241014165858.png]]

INTERSECTION TABLE IS REQUIRED FOR MANY :  MANY RELATIONSHIP

`select client_name, ename from projects_emp, emp, projects`
`where projects_emp.projno = projects.projno`
`and projects_emp.empno = projects.empno`
`order by 1, 2;`

TABLE :

![[Pasted image 20241014173205.png]]

## Sub-queries     /    Nested Queries

-  Nested queries  - ( Query within query )  ( SELECT within SELECT )

`select min(sal) from emp;`

3000

`select ename, min(sal) from emp;`              < -   ERRROR

`select ename from emp where sal - min(sal);`         < - ERROR

**Display the NAME who is receiving SAL = min( sal ):-**

`select ename from emp`                  <-   main query ( parent )  ( outer )
`where sal =` 
`(select min( sal ) from emp);`        <- sub-query      ( child ) ( inner )

- sub query will execute first   an return the value 3000
- value won't be displayed on screen
- it goes as a parameter in main query
- it will check sal == 3000 and return the name of the emp who is getting min sal

![[Pasted image 20241014175251.png]]

- the more the number of SELECT statements, the slower it will be

**Display the 2nd largest SAL :**

`select max(sal) frome emp`
`where sal < `
`(select max(sal) from emp);`

**Display all the rows who belong to the same DEPTNO as 'Thomas'**

`select * from emp`
`where deptno = `
`(select deptno from emp`
`where ename = 'Thomas');`

**Display all the rows who has same job as Kirun**             

`select * from emp`
`where job  = `                                     <-   returns   (  'C'  )
`(select job from emp`
`where ename = 'Kirun');`

**Using sub-query with DML commands**                  <- won't work in MySQL

`update emp set sal = 10000`
`where job  = `                                  
`(select job from emp`
`where ename = 'Kirun');`

`delete from emp`
`where job  = `                                  
`(select job from emp`
`where ename = 'Kirun');`

- ***Above 2 commands will not work in MySQL***
- ***Int\ MySQL you cannot update or delete from a table from which you are currently selecting***

**Using sub-query with DML commands**                  <-  works in MySQL

`update emp set sal = 10000`
`where job  = `                                  
`(select pqr.deptno from`
`(select job from emp`
`where ename = 'Kirun') pqr);`

`delete from emp`
`where job  = `                                  
`(select abcd.deptno from 
`(select job from emp`
`where ename = 'Kirun') abcd);`

![[Pasted image 20241014181845.png]]

**Multi-row sub0queries ( sub query returns multiple rows )**

**Display all the rows who are receiving a SAL = any of the Managers: 

`select * from emp`
`where sal = any`                                       ( 8000, 9000)
`(select sal from emp`
`where job = 'M`);`

`select * from emp`
`where sal in`                                             ( 8000, 9000)
`(select sal from emp`
`where job = 'M`);`


`select * from emp`
`where sal >=`                                             ( 8000 )
`(select min(sal) from emp`
`where job = 'M');`

-> Assumption,   3rd row SAL is 13000

**Display all the rows who are receiving a SAL > ALL the Managers **

INLINE VIEW :
-  if you have a sub-query in the FROM clause, then it's known as Inline view.

## Correlated sub-query ( using the EXISTS operator ) 

- this is the exception when sub-query is faster than join
- if you have a join alongwith DISTINCT, to make it work faster use Correkated sub-query ( use the EXISTS operator )

**Display the DNAMEs that contain employees**

solution 3 :
![[Pasted image 20241014200338.png]]

Explaination :
-  first the main query is executed
-  for every row returned by main query, it will run the sub-query once
-  sub-query returns Boolean TRUE value or FALSE value
-  if sub-query returns TRUE value, then main query is eventually executed for that row
-   if sub-query returns FALSE value, then main query is not eventually executed for that     row
-   unlike earlier, we do not use DISTINCT here, therefore no sorting takes place in server   RAM; this speeds it up
-  unlike a Join, the number of full table scans is reduce; this further speeds it up

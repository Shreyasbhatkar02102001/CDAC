# MySQL - Read and Write Consistency

*  in a multi-user environment
*  when you SELECT from a table you can view ONLY the committed data of all users plus/union
* changes made by you

### A -> Atomicity
*  the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all 
* ( e.g You withdraw Rs. 500/- from your Bank Account .. .. )

### C   -> Consistency
* the database must be consistent before and after the transaction
* ( e.g same as above, Deposits/Withdrawals and Balance tables ..........)

### I  -> Isolation
* mulitple transaction occur independently without interference
### D  -> Durability 
*  the changes of a successful transaction are permanently, even if later the system failure occurs



## Automatic row locking mechanism in MySQL :-

* When you UPDATE or DELETE a row, that row is automatically "locked"
   for other users
* ROW LOCKING IN MySQL IS AUTOMATIC
*  When you UPDATE or DELETE a row, that row becomes READ_ONLY
   for other users
*  Other users can SELECT from that table; they will view the old
   data "berfore" your changes.
* Other users can INSERT tows in that table.
*  Other users can UPDATE or DELETE  "other" row from that table
* No other user can UPDATE  or DELETE your locked row till you have issued a Rollback or Commit.*
* LOCKES ARE AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED WHEN YOU ROLLBACK OR COMMIT

## OPTMISTIC LOCKING

* Automatic row locking mechanism in MySql

## PESSIMISTIC LOCKING

*  Lock the rows manualyy in advance "BEFORE" issuing UPDATE or DELETE
*  ( to lock the rows manually you have to use SELECT statement with the FOR UPDATE clause )

* select * from emp for update
* where empno = 101                            
* for update;                                                    <---   by default 
*                                                                                  it will wait
*  int the request Queue till the row becomes availabler

* LOCKS ARE AUTOMATICALLY RELEASES WHEN YOU ROLLBACK OR COMMIT

select * from rmp 
 where deptno = 10
 from update nowait;*

<- if row is available, then lock it; else abort the operation

select * from rmp 
 where deptno = 10
 from update wait 30*                   <- seconds

* if row ia available, them lock it; wait in the request for the specified time period; if row is still unavailable *

Table :

#### Contraints

-  Limitations / Restriction imposed on a table 

PRIMARY KEY
-  KEY is another word for column
-  Primary column
-  Column or set that uniquely identifies a row
-  e.g. EMPNO
-  Duplicates values are allowed; it has to be unique
-  Null values are not allowed; this is a mandatory column 
-  it's  recommended that every table should have a Primary key; ot helps from a long-     term perspective
-  purpose of primary key is row uniqueness; with that help of Primary key column you    can distinguish between 2 rows of a table


![[Pasted image 20241016165800.png]]

-  Text and Blob cannot be primary key
-   Unique index is automactically created fro primary key column ( because primary key is the best column for searching )

`select * from emp where ename = A;`
`select * from emp where empno = 1;`

-  Composite Primary key -> combine 2 or more columns together to serve the purpose   of primary key; preferably they should be inter-dependent columns
-  In MySQL, you can combine upto 32 columns in a Composite primary key

![[Pasted image 20241016171152.png]]

-  if you have a Composite Primary Key, then a Composite Unique Index is automatically   created
-  you can have only 1 primary key per table
-  Candidate key - >  is not a constraint
-  Candidate key - >  is a  definition
-  Candidate key - > is a column that is primary in-waiting
-   CANDIDATE KEY ->  besides the primary key, any ither column in the table that could    serve the purpose of primary key, is a good candidate for primary key, is known as        candidate key

Steps for identifying primary key :-
	1.  Identify some key column and make it the primary key of you table
	2.  If you cannot identify some key column, then try to implement composite primary  key
	3.  If this is not  possible, then you add an extra column to the table to serve the purpose of primary key

![[Pasted image 20241016173010.png]]

SURROGATE KEY:
		-  It is not a constraint
		-  it is a definition
		-  When an extra column to table to serve the purpose of Primary key, then  such a primary key is known as Surrogate key
		-  Primary key is the best column for searching, and with CHAR datatype the        searching and retrieval is very fast; therefore for surrogate key the CHAR           datatype is recommended

-  all constraints are at Server level; you can perform the DML operations using MySQL     Command Line Client, or MySQL Workbench or Java or MS .Net , etc., or any other       front- end s/w the constraints will always be valid ( this concept is known as DATA      INTEGRITY )

To Change the primary Key column : - 
-  Drop the existing primary key constraint & alter table & then we can add new primary  key constraint

![[Pasted image 20241016175934.png]]

NOT NULL Constraint
-  Null values are not allowed
-  Duplicate values are allowed
-  Always a column level constraint

Comparison betweeen primary key and not null                <-   interview key

![[Pasted image 20241016180836.png]]

Entity Integrity ->  primary key
Referential Integrity -> Foreign key
Domain Integrity -> Datatype, e.g. int , char(10), etc.

- in MySQL, nullanibility is a part of the datatype
- to see that not  null columns:- 
-   desc emp;

![[Pasted image 20241016181353.png]]

Unique
-  duplicate values are not allowed 
-  null values are allowed
-  can INSERT any number of null values, but no duplicate values
-  unique index automatically created
-  text and blob cannot be unique
-  In MySQL, you can combine upto 32 columns in a composite unique

column lvl constraint can be written into table lvl constraint  except not null

![[Pasted image 20241016183749.png]]

-  column level constraint can be specified at table level ( end of structure ), but a table l level composite constraint can never be specified at column level
-  most developers prefer this, it make the CREATE table command more Readable 
-  Column level constraint can be specified at table level ( end of structure ), except for the not null constraint which is always a column level constraint and the syntax will not support you from specifying and therefore the syntax will not support you from specifying it at table level

![[Pasted image 20241016184756.png]]

1 column can have more than 1 constraint 
e.g. 
	PRIMARY KEY  and FOREIGN KEY
	not null and unique
	etc.

 Solution for Candidate key:
 not null constraint + unique index
 OR
 not null constraint + unique constraint

- with the help of above logic, indirectly you can have multiple primary keys in the table;  one directly, the remaining indirectly

![[Pasted image 20241016185142.png]]

ALTERNATE KEY ->  IS NOT A CONSTRAINT
ALTERNATE KEY -> is a definition
ALTERNATE KEY -> for the Candidate key column, if you give it a Not null constraint + unique index/constraint, then it becomes an Alternative to Primary key, then such a candidate key column is known as Alternate key


![[Pasted image 20241016185358.png]]

SUPER KEY ->  is not a constraint 
SUPER KEY ->  is a definition
SUPER KEY ->  if you have 1 or more Alternate keys in the tables, then the primary key is also known as super key

- primary key, not null , unique

Foreign Key

![[Pasted image 20241016193635.png]]

-  Foreign column ( column that is coming/ derived from elsewhere )
-  Column or set of columns that reference a column or set columns of some table
-  Foreign key constraint is specified on the child column ( not the parent column )
-  Parent column has to be primary key or unique ( this is a pre-requisite for foreign key )
-  Foreign key will allow duplicate values
-  Foreign key will allow null values also
-  Foreign key may reference column of same table also ( known as self-referencing )  (     parent column and child column both are present in the same table )

To disable the foreign key constraint:

on  delete cascade -> if you delete the parent row, then MySQL will automatically delete the child rows also

![[Pasted image 20241016202334.png]]
replace to update cascade with --------to retain the left child?

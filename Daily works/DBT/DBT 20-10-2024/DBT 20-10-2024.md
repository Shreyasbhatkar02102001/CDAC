#### STORED OBJECTS
-   objects that are stored in the DA?ABASE
-    CREATE........tables, indexesm views m stored procedures, stored functions
-    anything that you do with CREATE command is a stored object
#### Database Triggers  ( V. IMP )

-   present in some of the RDMS
-   Routine ( set of commands ) that gets executed AUTOMATICALLY whenever some  EVENT           takes place
-   Triggers are written on tables
-   Events are : -
	-  Before insert, after insert
	-  Before delete, after delete
	-  Before update, after update



`delimiter //`
`create trigger abc`
`before insert`
`on emp for each row`
`begin`
		`insert into tempp values(1, 'inserted');`
`end; //`

`delimiter ;`

-   trigger name :  should not be same as abc, max 30 characters
-   event :  before insert

-  within the trigger, a;; MySQL - PL statements allowed, 
-  e.g. variables, cursors, if statements , loops, sub-blocks, etc.
-  whether you Rollback or Commit AFTERWARDS, the data will always be consistent

![[Pasted image 20241020151654.png]]

-  that's why rollback and commit are not allowed in triggers

-  In MySQL , all triggers are at low level ( will fire once for each row )
-   In MySQL, you can have maximum 6 triggers per table

![[Pasted image 20241020153040.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241020153231.png]]
-     maintain standby database in the event of insert
-     AFTER INSERT trigger is recommended

![[Pasted image 20241020154655.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241020155656.png]]

if value is not mention during insert operations than trigger can also be used to provide default values as per table....refer to above to examples

Uses: - 
-   Maintain HISTORY tables in the event of delete
-   AFTER DELETE trigger is recommended
-   ON DELETE CASCADE BEFORE DELETE
-   in the above, set the child rows to NULL, BEFORE DELETE

NORMALISATION

-  applicable for RDBMS (e.g. MySQL ) and ORDBMS ( e.g. ORACLE )
-  conept of table design
-   RDBMS - >   1st to 4th Noraml form
-   DBMS - >   1st to 0th Normal form

-  Primary key is a by-product of normalization

![[Pasted image 20241020203850.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241020203936.png]]


Post-normalization

-   implementation  extension columns
-   Reserve some columns for logs of DML operations

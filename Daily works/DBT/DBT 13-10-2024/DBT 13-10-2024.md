## List - Functions

Independent of datatype

`select * from emp where comm = null;`                ->   wrong  while comparing it with null
- any comparision done with null, returns null

Pessimistic querying - > searching for null values;
 
`select * from emp where comm is null `               ->  correct

Special operator  - >  is  null  

`select * from emp where comm !=  null   `                   -> wrong
- any comparsion done with null, return null

`select * from emp where comm is not null;  `                   -> correct

`select sal + ifnull (comm, 0) from emp;`
- if comm is null then return 0;
- else return comm;

new table 

![[Pasted image 20241013144220.png]]

`select greatest(sal, 3000) from emp;`
- returns greater of the two;

o/p
![[Pasted image 20241013144358.png]]

uses:
a. to set a lower limmit on some value;
e.g. 
bonus = 10% sal, min bonus = 300

`select greatest(sal*0.1, 300) from emp;`

![[Pasted image 20241013144534.png]]


`select greatest(sal, 3000, 4000, 5000, 10000) from emp;`

![[Pasted image 20241013144653.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241013144838.png]]

`set x = greatest(a, b, c, d);`
- we can get max value by camparin it with various columns

`select least(sal, 3000) from emp;`
-  returns the smaller of two

![[Pasted image 20241013145146.png]]


uses:
a. TO SET AN UPPER LIMIT ON SOME VALUES

e.g.
`cashback = 10% amt. max cashback = 300`
`select least(amt*0.1, 300) from orders;`

![[Pasted image 20241013145717.png]]

`set x = least(a, b, c, d);`

![[Pasted image 20241013150050.png]]

training
training
exports
marketing        
others             =  default

-  if you don't specify else. and if DEPTNO 40 is present in the table, then it returns a  null value

Group/Aggregate Functions
![[Pasted image 20241013155129.png]]
Single-Row Functions:
- operate on 1 row at a time
- Character, Number, Date and Time, List, Environment 
- e.g. upper (ename) , round(sal) , etc.

Multi-Row Function:
- Operate on multiple rows at atime
- Group Functions
- e.g. sum(sal)

select sum(sal) from emp;
![[Pasted image 20241013155351.png]]

only 5 sal values will be sent from server to cilent

- Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:-

select sum(sal) from emp;         <- NULL VALUES ARE NOT COUNTED BY GROUP FUNCTIONS
![[Pasted image 20241013160323.png]]

SELECT AVG(SAL) FROM EMP;

26000/4     -> 6500      

SELECT AVG( IFNULL(SAL, 0) ) FROM EMP;

26000/5     ->  5200

---------------------------------------------------------
- Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:

`SELECT MIN( SAL ) FROM EMP;`

3000

`SELECT MIN( IFNULL( SAL, O) ) FROM EMP;`

0

`SELECT MAX( SAL ) FROM EMP;`

8000

`SELECT COUNT( SAL ) FROM EMP;`
- return a count of number of rows where SAL is not having a null value
4

`SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM EMP;`
- return a count of total number of rows in the table

`SELECT COUNT ( * ) - COUNT ( SAL ) FROM EMP;   ``
-  NOT RECEIVING SALARY

`SELECT MAX ( SAL ) / MIN ( SAL ) FROM EMP;`

8000/3000 -> 2.67

`SELECT SUM (  SAL ) / COUNT ( * ) FROM EMP;`       <-  FASTER (IT ITERATES ONE TIM  O(n))

26000/5      

`SELECT AVG (  IFNULL( SAL, 0) ) FROM EMP;    `         <-  SLOW (BCOZ IT ITERATES 2 TIMES O(n^2))

26000/5    

- Asumption, 4th row SAL is 9000:

`SELECT SUM ( SAL ) FROM EMP;`

![[Pasted image 20241013163200.png]]
- you cannot take avg of hireddate

`Select deptno, sum( sal ) from emp`
`where sal > 7000` ``     ``    <-       used to retrieve the rows
`group by deptno;`

- WHERE clause is specified before the group by clause

- if you have 1 column in GRoup by clause ->  2D query
- if you have 2 column in GRoup by clause ->  3D query
- if you have 3 column in GRoup by clause ->  4D query
- etc
- known as Multi-dimensional queries ( also known as spatial queries ) 

![[Pasted image 20241013182423.png]]

`select sum( sal ), deptno, job from emp`
`group by job, deptno;`
-  the position of columns in SELECT clause and the position of columns in GROUP BY clause not be the same
- the position of columns in SELECT clause will determine the position of columns in the output; this you will write as per user requirements
- the position of columns in GROUP BY clause will determine the sorting order, grouping order, summation order, and hence the speed of processing; this you will write as per count( distinct ( columnName ) )

select count( distinct deptno ), count ( distinct job ) from emp;

---------------
Having clause

![[Pasted image 20241013183929.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241013184512.png]]

- whichever column is oresent is SELECT clause, it can be used in HAVING clause

![[Pasted image 20241013184812.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241013184855.png]]

ORDER BY CLAUSE
![[Pasted image 20241013185418.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241013185521.png]]

- ORDER BY clause is the last clause in SELECT statement

select .................... from.....................
where...........................
group by.......................................
having ....................................
order by ........................................   ;

#### CURSORS  ( V. Imp ) ( Most Imp ) 

-   present in all RDMS, some DBMS, and some of the front-end s/w.
-   cursor is a type of a variable
-   cursor can store multiple rows
-   cursor is similar to 2D array
-   used for storing multiple rows
-   used for processing multiple rows
-   used for handling multiple rows
-   used for storing the data temporarily

net notes: 
-  Typically, you use cursors within stored procedures, triggers, and functions where you need **to  process individual rows returned by a query one at a time**.

`-- declare a cursor`
`DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR 
`SELECT column1, column2 
`FROM your_table 
`WHERE your_condition;

-  The cursor declaration must come after any [variable](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-stored-procedure/variables-in-stored-procedures/ "MySQL Variables in Stored Procedures") declaration. If you declare a cursor before the variable declarations, MySQL will issue an error. Additionally, a cursor must always associate with a `SELECT` statement.

`-- open the cursor
`OPEN cursor_name;

-  The `OPEN` statement initializes the result set for the cursor; therefore, you must call the `OPEN` statement before fetching rows from the result set.

`FETCH cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2;
`-- process the data

- Then, retrieve the next row pointed by the cursor and advance the cursor to the subsequent row in the result set using the `FETCH` statement:

`-- close the cursor
`CLOSE cursor_name; 

-  Finally, deactivate the cursor and release the memory associated with it using the `CLOSE` statement:

-   cursor has to be declared AFTER all the variables
-   cursor is bassed on SELECT statement
-    the SELECT statement on which the cursor is based could be anything, e.g. select col1, col2, /coln,  WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, GROUP BY clause, etc.
-   you can have cursor based on join, suib-queries set oeprators, view, etc;
-   you can have cursor based on computed column expression functions etc.

open c1   <-    It will ....

-  Input / Output is one
-   we have cursor pointer and by default it is pointing at  1st row
-    fetch will be perform and it will be fetching but make sure both emp and cursor should have same structure, else it will  rowmismatch
-   after fetch operation it will fetch the next row due to , while loop
-   again it will fetch from DB server HD to server RAM and point to next 3rd row
-   ...... it will continue like this until while loop returns false
-   end while
-    close cursor c1

close c1 <- THIS WILL CLOSE THE CURSOR C1 AND FREE THE RAM

-  you can only fetch 1 row a time

use of cursors: - 
a. used for storing/processing multiple rowa
b, used for locking the rows manually

###### TO LOCK THE ROWS MANUALLY:-

-  LOCKS ARE AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED WHEN YOU ROLLBACK OR COMMIT

STORED OBJECTS 

-   object that are stored in the database
-   e.g. CREATE. ............ TABLES, INDEXES, VIEWS, STORED PROCEDURES
-   anything that you do with CREATE command is a stored object

STORED FUNCTIONS

-   routine that returns a value  directly and compulsorily
-   global functions
-   stored in the database
-   can be called in MySQL command Line Client, MySQL workbench Java, MS .Net, etc.; canb e        called through any front-end s/w
-   stored in the database in the COMPILED FORMAT
-   hiding source code from end user
-   within the function, all MySQL-PL statements allowed, e.g. variables, cursors, IF statement,           sub- blocks, loops, etc.
-    stored procedure can call stored function
-     stored  function can call stored procedure
-    one function can call another function
-    function can call itself ( known as recursion )
-    to make it flexible, you can pass parameters to a function
-    OVERLOADING OF STORED FUNCTIONS IS NOT ALLOWED, because it's a stored object; you       cannot create 2 more functions with the same name even it the number of parameters                 passed is different or the DATATYPE  of parameters passed is different
-     IN parameters only


Stored functions are of 2 types: - 

1.  Deterministic
2.  Not Deterministic

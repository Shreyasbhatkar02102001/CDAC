#### SET OPERATORS

-  Foundation of RDMS based on SET theory
-  Founder of RDMS -> Dr. E. F.  codd 


-  structure of both the SELECT statements has to be same 
-  number of columns in both the corresponding datatypes have to match
-  the columnnames maybe different

`select empno, ename from emp1`
`union`
`select empnp, ename from emp2`
`order by 1;`

![[Pasted image 20241015162324.png]]

Union : 
		It will combine the output of both the SELECT statements and it will suppress the duplicates

`select empno, ename from emp1`
`union all`
`select empnp, ename from emp2`
`order by 1;`

![[Pasted image 20241015163614.png]]

Union All :
		It will combine the output of both the SELECT statements and the duplicates are not suppressed	

`select empno, ename from emp1`
`intersect`
`select empnp, ename from emp2`
`order by 1;`

![[Pasted image 20241015163859.png]]

Intersect :
		It will return what is common in both the SELECT statements and the duplicates are suppressed.

`select empno, ename from emp1`
`except`
`select empnp, ename from emp2`
`order by 1;`

![[Pasted image 20241015164140.png]]

Except :
		It will return what  is present in the first SELECT statement and not present in the second SELECT statements and the duplicates are suppressed


`select ....................`
		`union`
`select ...................`
		`intersect`
`select ...................`
		`union`
`select ...................`
		`union all`
`select ...................`
		`except`
`select ...................`
		`order by x`

-  max upto 255 SELECT statements
-  this limit of SQL can be exceeded with the help of views

#### Pseudocolumns

-  Fake columns ( virtual columns )
-  it's not a column of the table, but you can use it in SELCT statement

e.g 
	a.  Computed columns ( ANNUAL = sa;*12 )
	b. Expressions ( NET_EARNINGS  =  sal+comm-tax)
	c.  Function-based columns ( AVG_SAL = avg(sal),  R_SAL = round(sal, -3) )


#### RDBS supplied Pseudocolumns :

![[Pasted image 20241015171209.png]]


- RDMS supplied pseudocolumns
- ROWID
- ROWID stands for Row identifier
- ROWID is not a column of the table, but you can use it in SELECT statement
- ROWID is the row address
- ROWID is the actual physical memory location in the DB Server HD where that row is located
- When you SELECT from a table, the order of rows in the output depends on the row address; it will always  be in ascending order of ROWID
- ROWID is a fixed-length encrypted string of 18 characters
- when you UPDATE a row, if the row length is decreasing, then the addresses (ROWID) is will not change
- when you UPDATE a row, if the row length is increasing and if free space is not available then the addresses (ROWID) is will change
- No two rowa if any table in the entire DB Server HD can have the same ROWID
- ROWID works as an unique identifier for every row in the database
- ROWID is used by MySQL to distiguish between two rows in the DB Server HD


`select ename, sal from emp;`
`select rowid, ename, sal from emp`

![[Pasted image 20241015171226.png]]


-  you can use Rowid to UPDATE or DELETE the duplicate rows
-  Rowid is used internally by MySQL : -
	- Row Locking
	- to manage the indexes
	- to manage the cursors
	- to distinguish between two rows
	- row management
	- etc.

TABLE 
![[Pasted image 20241015173945.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241015174432.png]]

INDEXES

-  Indexes are present in all RDMS, all DBMS, and some of the programming languages also
-  to speed up the search operations ( for faster access )
-  to speed up the SELECT statement with a WHERE clause

![[Pasted image 20241015180810.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241015181139.png]]

-  In MySQL, the indexes are automatically invoked by the system as and when required 
-  In MySQL, the indexes are automatically updated by the system for all the DML operations
-  Duplicates values are stored in an index
-  No upper limit on the number of indexes per table
-  Larger the number of indexes, the slower would be the DML operations
-  cannot index text and blob columns
-  null values are not stored in an index

-  COMPSITE INDEX -> combine 2 or more INTER-DEPENDENT columns together in a single index

`select * from emp`
`where deptno = 1 and empno = 1;`

-  INDEX KEY -> column or set of column on whose basis the index has been created

![[Pasted image 20241015190449.png]]

-  In MySQL, you can combine upto 32 columns in a Composite index

![[Pasted image 20241015201841.png]]

-  at the time of creating the unique index, if you already have dupliacte values in EMPNO, the MySQL will not allow you to create the unique index

above 2 are the interview questions


#### Constraints 

-  Primary key
-  Not null
-  Unique
-  Foreign key
-  CHECK

CHECK : 
	-  Used for validations ( used for checking purposes )
	-   e.g. sal < 10000,  age  >  25,  etc.

`create table em
`(
`empno int auto_increment primary key,
`ename varhcar(25) check(ename = upper(ename)),
`sal float default 7000,
`check(sal between 5001 and 2999999),             <-  column level
`deptno int reference dept(deptno),
`status char(1) default 'T',
`check(status in('T', 'P', 'R')),                <-  column level
`comm float not null,
`mob_no char(15) unique,
`check(sal+comm < 5000000)                       <-  table level
`);

-  DEFAULT is not a constraint
-  DEFAULT is clause that you can use with CREATE TABLE
-  if you enter some values, them it will take that value; if nothing is specified, then it will  take default value

To make use of DEFAULT value , use of the following INSERT statement:

insert into emp(ename, deptno, comm , mob_no) values (................);

AUTO_INCREMENT -> by default is starts from 1, by default it increments by 1

-  ROLLBACK and COMMIT have no effect on auto_increment
-  ( it has been designed in this manner on purpose keeping in view a multi-user       environment )

To avoid the problem, of missing numbers:-
-  Do not issue the INSERT statement to the database at the time of data entry; when    user does the data entry, you store the rows in an array; when user issues a commit,    you issue the INSERT statement to the database followed by COMMIT

-------
SYSTEM TABLES
![[Pasted image 20241017163004.png]]
- MySQL created
-  Automatically created when you install MySQL
-  78 system tablea in MySQL v9
-  set of system tables is also known as DATABASES CATALOG
-  set of system tables is also known as DATA DICTIONARY
-  Stored in information_schema.
-  System tables store complete information about the database
-  e.g. statistics  ( for indexes ), table_constraints, key_column_usage, table_privileges, etc.

login as root user: -
use information_schema;
show tables;

DBA ->  Database Administrator
-  all the system tables are READ_ONLY

VIEWS : 
 -  present in all RDMS and some of the DBS
 -  view is a handle to a table
 -  Stores the address of the table
 -  view is HD pointer ( stores the address of the table ) ( known as LOCATOR )
 -  used for indirect access to the table
 -  used for SECURITY purposes
 -  used to restrict the access to users

-> view name and table should not be same

![[Pasted image 20241017175938.png]]

-  used to restrict the column access
-  VIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN DATA
-  only the definition is stored; data is not stored ( i.e select statement which is been    used ?)
-  view is a stored query ( store in the database )
-  SELECT statement  on which the view is based, it is stored in the DB in the COMPILED FORMAT
-  view is an executable format of SELECT statement
-  hence the execution will be very fast
-  hiding source code from end user ( if user wants source code then user has to pay for it )

![[Pasted image 20241017182239.png]]

( benefits :  faster, hides Source code and secure ) 

-  ENTIRE APPLICATION IS BASED ON VIEWS

![[Pasted image 20241017183344.png]]

-  used to restrict the row access

`insert into v2 values( 6, 'F', 6000, 2);`            <-  IT WILL ALLOW

![[Pasted image 20241017183843.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241017183946.png]]

- used to enforce different checks for different users

to change the SELECT statement of the view:-

To see the SELECT statement  on which the view  is based :-

![[Pasted image 20241017185950.png]]

-  view based on view is allowed
-  Uses :- 
	- To exceed the limits of SQL : -
		- i. UNION > 255 statements
		- ii. sub-query > 255 levels
		- iii. function within function > 255 levels

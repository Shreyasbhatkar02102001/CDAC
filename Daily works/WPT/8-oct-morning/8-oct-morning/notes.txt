As of now, all the APIs are open for all 
i.e. any one is this world who is having the url they can access the API
but this should not happen ideally 

In order to prevent the above behavior, we need to add authentication to the APIs

Admin Registration

Admin login 

Now, all the secure APIs should verify first that if admin has logged in or not 
if admin is logged in then only API should do its job 
otherwise if admin is not logged in then respond with error message 

Login API:
1. Receive username and password from request body
2. Match the username and password given by user in the request with the db values
Select * from admin where username=${request.body.username} and password=${request.body.password}

3. after matching into db:
	a. username and password matched: generate a token and send it in response  login successful and user is valid
	b. username and password didn't matched: respond with error message like invalid username or password 



Secured API:
1. first the secured api will receive the token on the request
2. Secured API now should verify the token
3. If token is valid then API will do its job
   If token is invalid or there is no token in the request then respond with error message 


Restro: Self Service

Payment Counter : authentication will be done, they will give a token 
Food Counter : customer will present the token and the employee at the food counter will verify the token, if token is valid then we will get access of the secured resource
Food is the secured resource 


For authentication purpose we will use JWT Token

Json Web Token

At the time of token generation we have to decide that what data we should contain inside a token with the help of json object

To generate a token we also need a secure key

var data = {
	userId: 101
}

sign(data)

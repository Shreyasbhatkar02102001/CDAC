Mount -> component is going to render on the browser
Unmount -> component is getting removed from the screen

React Js doesn't provides routing 
we will use react-router-dom

npm I react-router-dom

<BrowserRouter> -> to enable the routing within react app, we have wrap all the components inside BrowserRouter
<Routes> -> It is container for containing all the Route components
<Route> -> will contain the mapping of url with the component


Lifecycle of component:
From the starting/mounting to unmounting phase there are sequence of methods called on any component, those functions are known as lifecycle functions


lifecycle functions for class component :
constructor() -> only 1 time
render() -> 1st time it will be executed, the no. of times the state has been updated
componentDidMount() -> it will be called just after the first render only 
			eg: to fetch data from api call at the time of component mounting

componentDidUpdate() -> it will be called whenever component is updated due to re-rendering because of the state update 

componentShouldUpdate() -> before calling didUpdate, shouldUpdate() will be called 

componentDidCatch() -> it will handle the errors occurring in the component, ErrorBoundary

componentWillUnmount() -> it will be called just before the component is getting unmounted, so that we can perform certain cleanup task

Form data:

1. create a state to collect form data
2. As soon as user starts typing into the field, read fields value and assign into the proper state
3. At the time of submit, we have to read the form data from the state 

Event Handling in react:
if a function is getting called on to any event, then that function will automatically get an argument that will contain the occurred event object 

class component:

operation(e){
	e.target; // target will give the object of the element on which event is fired
}

<button onClick={this.operation}> click </button>

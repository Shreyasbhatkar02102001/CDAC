****REPL****

The Node.js REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) is an interactive shell that allows you to execute JavaScript code in real-time. It is a powerful tool for testing, debugging, and experimenting with code snippets without the need to create a full script.

****Starting the REPL****

To start the Node.js REPL, simply open your terminal or command prompt and type:

node
This will start the REPL session, indicated by the > prompt. You can now enter any valid JavaScript code, and the REPL will read the input, evaluate it, print the result, and loop back to wait for more input

****Basic Usage****

You can use the REPL to perform various operations, such as:

    > console.log('Hello, World!')
    Hello, World!
    undefined

    > 5 + 3
    8

    > let x = 10
    undefined

    > x * 2
    20
The REPL automatically prints the result of expressions, while statements like console.log return undefined

****Multiline Input****

For more complex code, the REPL supports multiline input. For example, to define a function:

    > function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    }
    undefined

    > add(2, 3)
    5
The REPL detects incomplete statements and allows you to continue typing on the next line


****Special Commands****

The REPL provides several special commands that start with a dot (.):

    .help: Displays help for REPL commands.

    .editor: Enters editor mode for writing multiline code.

    .break: Aborts the current multiline input.

    .clear: Clears the REPL context.

    .load <filename>: Loads a JavaScript file into the REPL.

    .save <filename>: Saves the current REPL session to a file.

    .exit: Exits the REPL
+

****Using REPL from a JavaScript File****

You can also start a REPL session from within a JavaScript file:

    const repl = require('node:repl');
    repl.start('> ');
    Run the file using:

    node repl.js
You can customize the prompt and handle the exit event to display a message:

    const local = repl.start('$ ');
    local.on('exit', () => {
    console.log('Exiting REPL');
    process.exit();
    });
This allows you to integrate REPL functionality into your Node.js applications


****Benefits****

The Node.js REPL provides immediate feedback, supports multiline input, allows variable assignment, and includes command shortcuts. It is an excellent tool for quickly testing and experimenting with code, evaluating expressions, inspecting objects, and troubleshooting problems interactively


In summary, the Node.js REPL enhances productivity by providing a flexible and efficient interface for Node.js development, making it an invaluable tool for developers

------ 

    process.stdout.write('Enter you simple equation : ');

above statement prints the output in same line

    console.log('Enter you simple equation: '); 

above output will print but next output after this will print in next line
